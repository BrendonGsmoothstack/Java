1. Which class would you use to store your birthday in years, months, days, seconds, and nanoseconds?
LocalDateTime class.

2. Given a random date, how would you find the date of the previous Thursday?
Using the previous method of a TemporalAdjuster

3. What is the difference between a ZoneId and a ZoneOffset?
Both of them track an offset from Greenwich/UTC time, but ZoneOffset 
ONLY tracks the absolute offset from Greenwich/UTC. ZoneId also uses 
ZoneRules to determine how an offset varies for a particular time of year/region.

4. How would you convert an Instant to a ZonedDateTime? How would you convert a ZonedDateTime to an Instant?

You can convert an Instant to ZonedDateTime by using the ZonedDateTime.ofInstant 
method. You also need to provide a ZoneId:

ZonedDateTime abc = ZonedDateTime.ofInstant(Instant.now(), ZoneId.systemDefault());

You can also use the Instant.atZone method:

ZonedDateTime abc = Instant.now().atZone(ZoneId.systemDefault());

You can use the toInstant method in the ChronoZonedDateTime interface, implemented 
by the ZonedDateTime class, to convert from a ZonedDateTime to an Instant:

Instant inst = ZonedDateTime.now().toInstant();
